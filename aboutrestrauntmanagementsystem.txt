Project Overview: Neha's Restaurant - A Full-Stack Management System
Neha's Restaurant is a complete, full-stack web application that serves as the digital backbone for a modern restaurant. It provides a seamless experience for customers to view the menu, book tables, and place orders, while also equipping the restaurant administrator with a powerful and secure control panel to manage all core operations in real-time.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the MERN stack, RESTful API design, database management, and professional front-end development, including advanced features like two-factor authentication and automated business logic.

Technologies Used
Frontend
React: The core library for building the dynamic and interactive user interface. All components, from the menu display to the admin dashboard, are built using React's component-based architecture.

Axios: A modern JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend REST API, enabling seamless data communication.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for all styling. It allowed for the rapid development of a custom, responsive, and visually stunning user interface.

Backend (MERN Stack)
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run the backend server. It's the foundation of the entire server-side application.

Express.js: The web framework used to build the REST API. It handles all routing, request handling, and middleware logic.

MongoDB: The NoSQL, document-oriented database used to store all the restaurant's data, including users, menu items, tables, reservations, and orders. We used MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a clear schema structure for our database models and simplifies interaction with MongoDB.

Security & External Services
Twilio: An industry-standard communications API used to send real-time SMS messages for the two-factor authentication (OTP) system.

dotenv: A utility to manage secret keys and environment variables securely, keeping credentials out of the source code.

Development & Deployment Tools
Postman: Used extensively during development to test all backend API endpoints and ensure their reliability.

Git & GitHub: For version control and for hosting the project's source code.

Render: A cloud platform used to deploy the backend API, making it publicly accessible.

Core Features Explained
The application is split into two main experiences: the public-facing customer view and the secure admin dashboard.

Customer-Facing Features
Dynamic Menu Display: The menu is not hardcoded. It dynamically fetches all menu items from the backend and elegantly groups them by category ("Appetizers," "Main Course," "Beverages") for a clean user experience.

Advanced Table Reservation: Customers can book a table for a specific date, time, and party size. The system features advanced time-based conflict resolution on the backend, preventing any table from being double-booked for overlapping time slots.

Seamless Ordering Workflow: The application provides a smart, connected workflow. After a customer successfully reserves a table, they are automatically taken to the "Place an Order" page, where the system already knows their table number, creating a seamless user journey.

Interactive Order Cart: Customers can add multiple items to their order, adjust quantities, and see the total price update in real-time before submission.

Professional Contact Page: A complete contact page provides users with the restaurant's address, a clickable Google Maps link for directions, business hours, and contact details.

Admin Control Panel Features
Secure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): The control panel is protected by a professional, two-step security system. The admin must first enter a secret password and then a time-sensitive, 6-digit OTP that is sent to their phone via Twilio SMS.

Table Management: The admin can view a summary of all table types (2-seaters, 4-seaters, etc.) and add new tables of any size with a single click. They can also view a live list of all current reservations and have the ability to cancel a reservation or delete a table.

Synchronized Menu & Inventory Management: This is a core automation feature.

Add Item: When an admin adds a new dish to the menu, the system automatically creates a corresponding entry in the inventory with a default quantity.

Delete Item: When an admin deletes a menu item, the system automatically deletes the corresponding item from the inventory.

Edit Item: The admin can update any item's details, such as its price or description.

Inventory Restocking: The "Manage Inventory" tab allows the admin to view the current stock of all items and easily update the quantities to restock them.

Order History: The "View Orders" tab provides a complete history of all orders placed, showing the table number, items ordered, total price, and timestamp.

Key Talking Points for Recruiters
When explaining this project, here are the most impressive points to highlight:

Full-Stack Development: "I built this application from the ground up, handling everything from the frontend UI in React to the backend API in Node.js and the database modeling in MongoDB."

RESTful API Design: "I designed and built a complete RESTful API with endpoints for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all major resources like the menu, tables, and reservations."

Advanced Business Logic: "I implemented advanced business logic on the backend, such as a time-based reservation system with conflict detection to prevent double-booking, and an automated inventory system that decrements stock in real-time when an order is placed."

Security Implementation: "For the admin panel, I built a professional two-factor authentication system using a password and a real-time OTP sent via the Twilio SMS API to secure access."

Deployment & Cloud Experience: "The backend API is not just local; it is fully deployed to the cloud using Render, and I managed all the environment variables and deployment configurations."

User-Centric Frontend: "On the frontend, I focused on creating a seamless user experience, like the smart workflow that automatically takes a user from a successful reservation to the order page for their specific table."
