Of course. Here is a complete breakdown of your project that you can use for your internship presentation and video.

## Project Overview: Restaurant Management System API
This project is a backend server designed to be the digital backbone of a restaurant. It handles all the core operational logic, from what's on the menu to tracking inventory. It doesn't have a user interface (frontend); instead, it provides a powerful API (Application Programming Interface) that a website or mobile app could use to manage the restaurant.

## Technologies Used
Frameworks & Runtime
Node.js: This is the JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code on a server instead of just in a web browser. It's the foundation of our entire application.

Express.js: This is the web framework we used to build the API. It simplifies creating routes (URL endpoints), handling requests, and managing responses. Think of it as the scaffolding that gives our Node.js application structure and makes it easy to build a web server.

Mongoose: This is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB. It allows us to define a clear structure (a "schema") for our data and provides a straightforward way to create, read, update, and delete documents in the database directly from our JavaScript code.

Database
MongoDB: We used MongoDB as our database. It's a NoSQL, document-oriented database, which means it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This makes it very easy to work with in a JavaScript-based application. We used MongoDB Atlas, which is the cloud-hosted version of the database.

Tools
Postman: An essential tool for API development. We used Postman to act as a client to test our API endpoints. It allowed us to send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and view the server's responses without needing a frontend.

Nodemon: A development utility that automatically restarts the server whenever we save a file. This greatly speeds up the development process by instantly applying our code changes.

## Database Models (The Data Architecture)
We designed five interconnected models to represent the restaurant's data:

MenuItem: Represents a single item on the menu, containing its name, description, price, and category.

Table: Represents a physical table in the restaurant with a tableNumber, capacity, and a status (isOccupied).

Inventory: Tracks the stock of sellable items. Each document has an itemName, the quantity in stock, and the unit of measurement.

Reservation: Connects a customer to a Table at a specific reservationTime. It holds customer details and references the specific table being booked.

Order: The most complex model. It links a Table to an array of MenuItems that have been ordered, and includes the totalAmount and status of the order.

## Core Functionalities
This API provides the following key features:

Full CRUD Operations: The system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for the primary resources: Menu Items, Tables, and Inventory.

Reservation Management: The API can create and view reservations. The key business logic here is conflict detection, which prevents a table from being double-booked by checking for existing reservations within a specific time window.

Order Processing: The API allows for the creation of complex orders containing multiple menu items and quantities for a specific table. It automatically calculates the totalAmount based on the prices of the items ordered.

Automated Inventory Control: This is the project's core automation feature. When a new order is successfully created, the system automatically decrements the stock of the corresponding items in the inventory. It also checks if there is enough stock before placing the order to prevent selling items that are unavailable.

## How to Explain it in a Video
Hereâ€™s a simple script to demonstrate the project's power in your video:

"Let me show you the main feature. First, I'll send a GET request to our inventory to check the stock of our 'Test Shake'. As you can see, the quantity is 100."

(Show Postman with the GET /api/inventory request and response)

"Now, a customer at Table 1 wants to order five Test Shakes. I'll simulate this by sending a POST request to the /api/orders endpoint, providing the table ID and the menu item ID for the shake."

(Show Postman with the POST /api/orders request and body)

"The API processes the request, calculates the total price, and returns a 201 Created status, confirming the order was placed."

(Show the successful order creation response)

"But here's the key automation. If I go back and run the GET request for our inventory again..."

(Run the GET /api/inventory request again)

"...you can see the quantity for 'Test Shake' has been automatically reduced to 95. This shows the system's ability to manage stock in real-time based on orders, which is a critical function for any restaurant."
